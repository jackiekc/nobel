=================================
Version 1.0.2 - November 16, 2012
=================================
- Updated to PhoneGap 2.2.0
- FIXED: App delegate surrogate handling was causing edge case issues 
  with iOS 6 and certain plugin combinations
- FIXED: setting an alias to an empty string results in subsequent
  registration failures
- Changed default value of UAPushEnabled to NO in NSUserDefaults on app launch. 
  This only affects the iOS plugin using v1.3.5 of libUAirship.a or greater.
  If you have used previous versions of the plugin, you should update your
  app in order to reflect this change, in order to see the same behavior.
